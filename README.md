# Analyze_Weather_Data

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Analyze Weather Data project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing and visualizing historical weather data from multiple cities. Using Jupyter notebooks, this project offers detailed insights into temperature trends and correlations between various weather attributes.
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>1. Data Loading: Loads multiple CSV files containing historical weather data for different cities.</p>
<p>2. City Selection: Users can specify a city to view data corresponding to that city.</p>
<p>3. Data Visualization: Generates interactive visualizations including:</p>
<p>4. Temperature trend plots over time for the selected city.</p>
<p>5. Correlation heatmaps to illustrate relationships between different weather attributes.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The project utilizes historical weather data stored in CSV files. These datasets include attributes such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and more. The CSV files should be named in a way that reflects the city or weather attribute they represent.

# Structured Approch 
<h2>1. Understand the Data</h2>
<p>1. Content: The dataset contains hourly measurements of weather attributes for ~5 years.</p>
<p>2. Attributes: Weather attributes include temperature, humidity, air pressure, weather description, wind direction, and wind speed.</p>
<p>3. Geographical Scope: 30 US and Canadian cities, 6 Israeli cities.</p>
<p>4. Organization: Each attribute has its own file, with rows representing the time axis and columns representing cities.</p>

<h2>2. Set Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>1. Programming Language: Python is ideal for data analysis due to its rich ecosystem of libraries.</p>
<p>2. Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy.</p>

<h2>3. Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>1. Load Data: Read the data from the files into Pandas DataFrames.</p>
<p>2. Clean Data: Handle missing values, correct data types, and handle any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>3. Merge Data: Combine the different attributes into a single DataFrame based on the time axis and city.</p>

<h2>4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
<p>1. Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, variance, etc., for each attribute.</p>
<p>2. Visualizations: Create plots to understand the distribution and trends of the data.</p>
<p>3. Line plots for temperature, humidity, pressure over time.</p>
<p>4. Heatmaps for correlation between different attributes.</p>
<p>5. Box plots to observe the spread and outliers in the data.</p>
<p>6. Seasonal trends (daily and yearly cycles).</p>

<h2>5. Signal Processing Concepts</h2>
<p>1. Filtering: Apply filters to smooth the data and remove noise.</p>
<p>2. Fourier Transform: Analyze periodic components in the data.</p>
<p>3. Auto-correlation: Measure how the data is correlated with itself over different time lags.</p>
<p>4. Cross-correlation: Measure how different weather attributes are correlated with each other.</p>

<h2>6. Advanced Analysis</h2>
<p>1. Seasonality and Trends: Decompose time series data into seasonal, trend, and residual components.</p>
<p>2. Anomalies Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in the weather data.</p>
<p>3. Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict future weather conditions.</p>
<p>4. Time series forecasting using ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet.</p>
<p>5. Machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.</p>

<h2>8. Correlation with Other Data</h2>
<p>1. External Datasets: Correlate weather data with other datasets (e.g., crime rates, traffic, public transport usage).</p>
<p>2. Case Studies: Analyze specific events (e.g., impact of weather on wildfires, cab demand).</p>

<h2>9. Presentation and Reporting</h2>
<p>1. Interactive Dashboards: Create dashboards using libraries like Dash or Streamlit to visualize findings.</p>
<p>2. Reports: Summarize your findings in a detailed report or presentation.</p>
